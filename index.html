							<h2>Description</h2>
							<p>“The power adapter may become very warm during normal use as it dissipates operational heat through the adapter casing. If you’re using the AC power cord, place the MagSafe Power Adapter on a desk, table, or on the floor in a well-ventilated location. Avoid thick carpet, bedding, or furniture that would impact airflow on the adapter as those items may trap heat radiated from the adapter case. Similarly, avoid prolonged contact between yourself and the adapter brick when the adapter is in use.” -Apple Technical Support</p>
							<p>This product slips around the Apple power adapter to elevate it and allow it to breathe and dissipate its heat when placed on more insulating surfaces and prevents the power block from becoming excessively hot. It serves the secondary purpose of providing a storage area for both an extension and regular cord as additional utility built in.</p>

							<h2>Description</h2>
							<p>Pump bottles pose a very large problem for travelers. Most of the time, people do not bring a pump bottle in their suitcase because they know it will inevitably leak in their suitcase. There are some solutions to this problem (twist down pump, travel containers), but they all waste a lot of product.</p>
							<p>This product is the solution to the bottle problem, and it is adjustable both width- and height-wise. The design was inspired by a binder clip, which allows the bottle stopper to grip the neck of different pump widths. It can also be adjusted to the height of 4.5 cms.</p>
